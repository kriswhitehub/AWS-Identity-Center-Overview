### AWS Identity Center Overview


###### AWS IAM Identity Center: 

* (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) is a cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) service that helps you centrally manage and control access to your AWS resources.

###### IAM Identity Center Benefits:

* Single sign-on (SSO) to AWS accounts and applications - IAM Identity Center allows your workforce users to sign in to all their AWS accounts and applications with a single set of credentials. It reduces risk of password fatigue and increases productivity.
* Centralized user management - IAM Identity Center allows you to create, manage, and delete users and groups centrally. This makes it easier to keep track of your users and their permissions.
* Role-based access control (RBAC) - IAM Identity Center supports RBAC, which allows you to grant users permissions to specific AWS resources. This helps you to secure your AWS environment and prevent unauthorized access.
* Fine-grained access control - IAM Identity Center allows you to define fine-grained access control policies for your AWS resources. This helps you to ensure that users only have access to the resources that they need.
* Auditing and reporting - IAM Identity Center provides auditing and reporting capabilities that help you to track user activity and identify potential security risks.
* IAM Identity Center can be used by organizations of all sizes. It is a scalable and cost-effective solution that can help you to improve the security and efficiency of your AWS environment.

Use Cases:

1. To provide SSO to AWS accounts and applications.
2. To centralize user management.
3. To implement RBAC.
4. To define fine-grained access control policies.
5. To track user activity and identify potential security risks.
